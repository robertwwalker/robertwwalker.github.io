# An Amazing Pigeon Becomes a Palette

It really is an amazing pigeon.  Apologies that I haven't a photo credit for it; I found it one day on twitter as it went viral.  It is a New York City pigeon.

![Pigeon](img/Pigeon.png)

I want to color something with colors from that pigeon.  First, I have to get the color palette.

## `imgpalr`

{{< fa brands r-project >}} has a package called `imgpalr` that will extract colors from an image.  If I need to, it is `install.packages("imgpalr")`.

In the following code chunk, I will load the package and then I want to point it to the pigeon image that I downloaded.  In my case, it is in the same directory as the R Markdown file and is called `Pigeon.png`.

Inside the command `image_pal()`, I point it to an image, I specify how many colors [5], what type of color scheme, I want qualitative, and then some characteristics of the colors.  The plot will show me the image alongside the palette though it is upside down.

```{r}
library(imgpalr)
Pigeon.colors <- image_pal("img/Pigeon.png", # This will need to be adjusted to the actual file location on your computer.  Mine is in my downloads.
          n = 20, # How many colors?
          type = "qual", # Type of palette?
          saturation = c(0.75, 1), 
          brightness = c(0.75, 1), 
          plot = TRUE, # Show the image and the palette?
          bw = c(0.7, 0.95)
          )
Pigeon.colors
```

Now I have a palette in the markdown environment called Pigeon.colors.  

## Data to plot

Now I need some data; I want five categories to match my palette.  The rest is junk.

```{r}
Junk.data <- data.frame(Stuff=c("Hi","Howdy","Hello","Hola","Hallo"), vals = runif(5, 0.4, 1))
Junk.data
```

I want to graph it using a barplot equivalent because I have the height of the bars in `vals`.  Let me use the fill aesthetic to fill the bars in by the five discrete things stored as `Stuff`.  The trick to using it is to manually specify the colors and point it to the `Pigeon.colors` above.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(Junk.data) + aes(x=Stuff, y=vals, fill=Stuff) + geom_col() + scale_fill_manual(values = Pigeon.colors) + hrbrthemes::theme_ipsum_rc()
```
