Trump ineligible for the ballot in Colorado as a result of the insurrection on January 6.  The ultimate decision was described as unanimous though there may be something else going on.  Rumors are circulating that there was some dissent though it did not make it into the final version.  To have a look, I grabbed the opinion as issued.  You can find it [here](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-719_19m2.pdf).\n\nFirst, I will need three packages.  `stringr` for string detection, `pdftools` for importing the pdf and the `tidyverse` by habit.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(pdftools)\nlibrary(stringr)\n```\n:::\n\n\nLet's import the file and then just see if the stem \"dissent\" exists.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nOpinion <- pdf_data(\"./data/23-719_19m2.pdf\")\ntable(str_detect(unlist(Opinion), \"dissent\"))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n\nFALSE  TRUE \n38097     3 \n```\n:::\n:::\n\nThree times.  Now let's find them.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nstr_locate_all(Opinion, \"dissent\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[[1]]\n     start end\n\n[[2]]\n     start end\n\n[[3]]\n     start   end\n[1,] 10548 10554\n\n[[4]]\n     start end\n\n[[5]]\n     start end\n\n[[6]]\n     start end\n\n[[7]]\n     start end\n\n[[8]]\n     start end\n\n[[9]]\n     start end\n\n[[10]]\n     start end\n\n[[11]]\n     start end\n\n[[12]]\n     start end\n\n[[13]]\n     start end\n\n[[14]]\n     start end\n\n[[15]]\n     start  end\n[1,]  7254 7260\n\n[[16]]\n     start end\n\n[[17]]\n     start end\n\n[[18]]\n     start end\n\n[[19]]\n     start end\n\n[[20]]\n     start  end\n[1,]  7367 7373\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nSo they appear in the third, fifteenth, and twentieth sections.  Three is still the decision and twenty is the last item.  So let's start with the 15th section and render the complete text that it contains.\n\n\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncat(Opinion[[15]][[\"text\"]], sep=\" \")\n```\n\nCite as: 601 U. S. ____ (2024) 1 , J., concurring in part dissenting part S OTOMAYOR S OTOMAYOR , K AGAN , and J ACKSON , JJ., and concurring in in judgment SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES _________________ No. 23–719 _________________ DONALD J. TRUMP, PETITIONER v. NORMA ANDERSON, ET AL . ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF COLORADO [March 4, 2024] J USTICE S OTOMAYOR , J USTICE K AGAN , and J USTICE J ACKSON , concurring in the judgment. “If it is not necessary to decide more to dispose of a case, then it is necessary not to decide more.” Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, 597 U. S. 215, 348 (2022) (R OBERTS , C. J., concurring in judgment). That fundamen- tal principle of judicial restraint is practically as old as our Republic. This Court is authorized “to say what the law is” only because “[t]hose who apply [a] rule to particular cases . . . must of necessity expound and interpret that rule.” Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137, 177 (1803) (emphasis added). Today, the Court departs from that vital principle, decid- ing not just this case, but challenges that might arise in the future. In this case, the Court must decide whether Colo- rado may keep a Presidential candidate off the ballot on the ground that he is an oathbreaking insurrectionist and thus disqualified from holding federal office under Section 3 of the Fourteenth Amendment. Allowing Colorado to do so would, we agree, create a chaotic state-by-state patchwork, at odds with our Nation’s federalism principles. That is enough to resolve this case. Yet the majority goes further. Even though “[a]ll nine Members of the Court” agree that this independent and sufficient rationale resolves this case,\n\nSo apparently, someone was talked into a change.\n\n# References\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nknitr::write_bib(names(sessionInfo()$otherPkgs), file=\"bibliography.bib\")\n```\n:::\n",
